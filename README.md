Here we used one pre-defined module which is:

-> smtplib - This module defines an SMTP client session object that can send mail to any Internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon.

In this python program, I sent emails to my fellow mates who were taken part in our tech fest.
Please change the message in the program to meet your requirement.
 
Replace the following attributes in the python file to send customized emails for huge numbers:

* Test Name with Your Name.
* Testmail@email.com with your mail.
* Test password with mail Password.
* Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server with 
* smtp.office365.com(for Outlook)
* smtp.gmail.com(for Gmail)

You must provide a file in excel format to send emails in a huge number.
For sending mail with a subject we include:

Note: In Python 3.8 they already pre_imported this smtplib module. Try to restart Python after importing the module.

If you get any import error use ***pip install secure-smtplib*** to import the module and do this in Command_Prompt.
