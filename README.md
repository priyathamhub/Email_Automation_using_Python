# Send_Email_Using_Python
# Note: Here I am Using Gmail Account
This Repository is useful to everyone to send email using Python and I will Start From Scratch. 
Seriously Speaking I faced a lot of Problems while sending a mail using Python so I included comments for better understanding to everyone.

I highly recommend setting up a throwaway account for the development of your code. This is because you’ll have to adjust your Gmail account’s security settings to allow access from your Python code, and because there’s a chance you might accidentally expose your login details. Also, I found that the inbox of my testing account rapidly filled up with test emails, which is reason enough to set up a new Gmail account for development.

Step-1: Create a new Google account.
Turn Allow less secure apps to ON. Be aware that this makes it easier for others to gain access to your account.
To Goto Secure apps Settings follow this "Google Account Settings->Security->Secure apps" (or) https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps

Step-2: Let's get into Python Script.

Here we used one predefined module which is :

-> smtplib - This module which defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mail to any Internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon.

Note: In python 3.8 they already pre_imported this smtplib module.
Try to restart Python after importing the module.
If you get any import error use "pip install secure-smtplib" to import the module and do this in Command_Prompt.
